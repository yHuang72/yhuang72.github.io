title: 558 Course feedback
---

## How is the course going so far?

**558 is greate. I am enjoy learning it so far. My Mid exame is not very good. I guess I made many mistakes about it. I am not a fan about any exame. But I still like take it.**

## What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?
**I like do home work. It let me improve my coding skill and more familar with the R. The home work and project looks little more for me. I hope I have some resourse of course note. The sample of code in the course is usufull. I hope the exame will be changed. If we have to have exame, it should be simple as the r code.**

## Any other thoughts? 
**Maybe we can review some code of others, to learn what kind code is good or not good enough.**
