title: R VS SAS
---
### I have 4 years SAS work experience. SAS EG is my main tools.   

**What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?**  

I think R language is more flexible. The command with stain(%<%) is my fervor one. It let the grogram or queries looks neat and logic.
R function is my another fervor part. In SAS Sometime you felt less creativities.(SAS has command like function. But I have not use it yet.) By the way R packages are wonderful. There are many packages on the website.

**What functionality do you like about R?** 

I like R functions(). It is very good to create a special tool or package to handle the special tasks.

**What parts do you miss about your other language?**  

SAS Document is very clearly and easy to understand. I will understand more when I use the help() to check R functions. 



**Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?** 
It is easy to learn. And I'd like to say ST558 is great. I just spend 2 week then I can write a simple function. It is great. 
If you want to learn R, I high commend you to take ST558(651) in NC state Univercity.
