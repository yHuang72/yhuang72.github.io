title: Become a data data scientist!
---

Data scientist is a very popular career in workplace. If you want become a data scientist, you need to answer the questions below:


(1) What do you think being a data scientist is about? 


You are a scientist. You research subject is big data. You like to deal with big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data. 
You are analytical experts who utilize their skills in both technology and social science to find trends and manage data. 
After you involves any business or project it should be to making sense of messy, unstructured data, from sources such as smart devices, social media feeds, and any information that don’t neatly fit into a database.


(2) What do you see as the main knowledge areas? 


A data scientist’s role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. You should have below knowledge or skills:
1. Probability & Statistics
2. Multivariate Calculus & Linear Algebra
3. Programming, Packages and Softwires 
4. Database Management
5. Data Visualization
6. Machine Learning


(3) What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 


They are similarities because they dealing with data. They collect data, analysis data and build model to fit data. While data scientists focus on comparing a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model, statisticians rather work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data. Statisticians tend to focus more on quantifying uncertainty than data scientists.


(4) How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?


I like to become a data scientist rather than statisticians. But statistical is the foundation. Many software and statistical package need to understand how to better use them. I have three years of SAS experience at CMG has allowed me to be proficient with many SAS statistical procedures such as PROC NLIN, PROC DISCRIM, and PROC ARIMA, and deepened my understanding of the application of statistical and mathematical methods. For the future, I envision advancing my career to become a Data scientist by employing advanced statistical methods. 


How about you? Do you want to jump in?
