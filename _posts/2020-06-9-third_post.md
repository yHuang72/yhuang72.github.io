---

## About my project.

**This is the first time, I use API data to analysis the hockey sport. API is a very interesting Json data. There are lot free resource can be sue. Use Json package I require and converse 4 data frame. It is about NHL franchise information. It is a cool project. This project is home work of NC state university ST558.I highly recommend you take this course when you think we want take a ticket in data sciences area. Please chlick the link to find my project.**

## what's differently?
**On this project, I try a new way to let readers have a base still and method to access Json data and do some simple data analysis.All analysis focus on the wins/losses rate.Wins/losses rate represent the teamâ€™s power Then wins/losses rate something variable depend on the game type. Also I analysis home wins/losses rate. It is except the home wins/losses rate is high than wins/losses rate.**

## what's the most difficult part?

**The difficult part of the project is that I am not familiar with hockey.  If you want to analysis sport data and then write some report that is fine. If you want to find some more interesting thing even it can improve the team ability. You need to deeper understand Hockey. So try to understand what data mean  spend my much time to start my project.**

## what did I get from this project?

**I like this project because I take-aways from this project.I know more new thing with more train you skill and capability of understanding.One of my take-aways from this project is that I familiar with ggplot2 package and tidyverse package. 
The second thing is very important too.  This project let me start to think how to access a API and create a automatic analysis report for multiple users.Finally, this project is a very good chance to know you can do more than you think.**
