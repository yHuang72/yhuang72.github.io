## About my project.

**This is a new project that using onlineNews data set to exam linear and nonlinear model. After using both way to fix the model, we try to using automatic output to create 7 report.
The reports are depend on the article that post on weekday.

## what's differently?
**On this project, I try a new way to automatic output the report. It is success. I use the boost tree as my nonlinear model. And using 10 fold cv with 3 repeat to fix the model. The R  Caret package is great. There are tones mothed you can choice.**

## what's the most difficult part?

**The difficult part of the project is that I try to fix the linear regression model. The r square is very low. And AIC is large. It looks like the linear regression model does not fix the data well. I spend a lot time to try to fix it. Finally I just use full variable to fix the model. This week we also learn the R cluster skill. It maybe is a good way to deal with the wide spread respond variable “Shares” too. But the time was running off. So I have to submit my report.**

## what did I get from this project?

**I learn many skill in this project. The first is the automatic to output the report. It is funny because it will save a lot time. Also it let me think of how to create a fixable report to different  user. It is great. And I also review many things that learn in this class. 
Happy Independent Holiday.
