### I have 4 years SAS work experience. SAS EG is my main tools.   

 
**what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do**  
I think R language is more flexible. The command with stain(%<%) is my fervor one. It let the grogram or queries looks neat and logic.
R function is my another fervor part. In SAS Sometime you felt less creativities.(SAS has command like function. But I have not use it yet.) By the way R packages are wonderful. There are many packages on the website.


**what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?** 
I like R functions(). It is very good to create a special tool or package to handle the special tasks.

**what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?**  
SAS Document is very clearly and easy to understand. I will understand more when I use the help() to check R functions. 

**Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?**
