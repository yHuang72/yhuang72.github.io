### 558 reflection.  

 

**what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do**  
A data scientist need a powerful analysis tool. R is one of them. More powerful tools you have, more fact and predict you can got. 


**what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?** 
I will keep using R. Because R is more complicate than SAS, and more creative. I already spend a lot time on it and got much from it. I will get more if I keep use it. 

**what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?**  
I think R APP is my target. It can be a product. It will be a speciate tools or said a funny tools to do something.
