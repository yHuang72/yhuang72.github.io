title: R VS SAS
---
### I have 4 years SAS work experience. SAS EG is my main tools.   

**What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?**  
I think R language is more flexible. The command with stain(%<%) is my fervor one. It let the grogram or queries looks neat and logic.
R function is my another fervor part. In SAS, there are many products. But you only using it. It is easy to call. But sometime you will feel less creativities.(SAS has something like function create. But I never use it.)

**What functionality do you like about R?** 
I like R functions(). It is very good to create a special tool or product to handle the special tasks.

**What parts do you miss about your other language?**  
SAS Document is very clearly. But I like “cheat sheet” too. 

**Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?** 
It is easy to learn. And I will say ST558 is great. I just spend 2 week then I can write a simple function. It is great. 
If you want to learn R, I high commend you to take ST558(651) in NC state Univercity.
